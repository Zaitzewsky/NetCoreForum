# NetCoreForum
An online forum developed in .Net Core. This is a sideproject to learn more about .Net Core, CI, CD and deployment (and hosting) in AWS.  *DISCLAIMER* This project is put on hold due to .Net Core being in to much of an adolescent state at this point to support my architectural design. There are too many workarounds to make it work so I will let .Net Core sit for a bit and I'll continue doing this project in standard .Net 4.6 instead.
